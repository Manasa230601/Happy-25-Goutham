    <h2>A Letter for You 💛</h2>

    <p>
      Happy birthday to my best friend of my life.<br><br>

      You are very special to me, and on this day you deserve to know that I love you more than anyone else.
      I’m really glad that we met and that we became best friends.<br><br>

      I know you don’t like big words or loud emotions, but I want you to know this clearly.
      You don’t have to prove anything to anyone.
      You don’t have to carry everything alone.<br><br>

      You are doing more than enough, even on the days it doesn’t feel like it.<br><br>

      No matter how life changes, how busy it gets, or how heavy things feel,
      this place, this bond, and I will always be here for you.<br><br>

      I hope this year is kinder to you.
      I hope it gives you peace, growth, and moments where you can finally breathe.<br><br>

      You don’t have to say anything.
      I just wanted you to have this.<br><br>

      Love you so much,<br>

  // REASONS
  const dialogues = [
`You never made me feel like I was under pressure, especially with money or life.
No matter if it was 5 am or 12 am, I could ask you freely.
You never made things feel tough, and that safety meant everything to me.`,

`I’ve watched how you work through hard times without searching for excuses.
You stay up late, wake up early, and keep going quietly.
That strength and responsibility is something I’ve never seen in anyone else.`,

`When I’m with you, I feel complete.
We fight, laugh, irritate each other, but nothing ever feels heavy for long.
With you, happiness feels natural and effortless.`,

`Even when people hurt you deeply, you don’t carry it with you.
You don’t dig into the past or hold grudges.
You choose peace silently, and that strength is rare.`,

`For even the smallest things in my life, family or personal, you are my first person.
I don’t need big words or reactions from you.
Just knowing I can tell you everything feels enough.`,

`Even when we fight badly, you never let the bond break.
No matter the silence, blocking, or distance, things always find their way back to calm.
That consistency makes me feel secure.`,

`I feel safe knowing this bond won’t break easily.
Days don’t pass without us talking, even when things aren’t perfect.
Nothing in life is permanent, but my presence with you is constant.`,

`Our days are never boring.
We fight, tease, irritate each other, and still laugh like nothing happened.
Your presence changes the vibe without you even noticing.`,

`You changed the way I look at effort and responsibility.
From you, I learned consistency, hard work, and not giving up easily.
Those lessons stayed with me more than you know.`,

`You make me feel chosen through actions, not words.
Checking if I ate, bringing food during shifts, caring quietly.
Those small things made me feel important.`,

`I deeply admire how you treat people.
You make others feel seen, especially when they feel hurt or uncomfortable.
That comfort you create naturally is rare.`,

`You support me even before I ask.
When I hesitate, you step in on your own, no questions asked.
Time, effort, even money, you never think twice.`,

`With you, I feel calm, safe, and complete.
Sometimes I can’t even sleep until you’re there.
The moment I see you beside me, my mind rests.`,

`Even when things bother you, you don’t show irritation.
You stay calm and present instead of reacting.
That quiet patience makes everything lighter for me.`,

`I trust you without needing reasons.
I share even the smallest doubts and decisions with you.
You always find solutions when others can’t.`,

`The names we call each other say everything.
Bandaluuu, Barrelu, Bujji Konda.
They carry comfort and closeness only we understand.`,

`I know that when things get bad, you will be there.
Not with big promises, but with presence.
Even when things are out of our control, we stand together.`,

`You understand me without words.
You notice my silence, my mood, my happiness, my sadness just by looking.
Without making it heavy, you make me laugh within minutes.`,

`You feel deeply but never show it loudly.
You observe more than you speak and carry things silently.
That depth is something only people close to you see.`,

`You don’t seek attention, but your presence changes everything.
When you’re around, things feel calmer and lighter.
That quiet impact is powerful.`,

`You are emotionally independent in a rare way.
You don’t need validation or reassurance.
You know who you are, and that confidence shows.`,

`You process emotions internally before reacting.
You don’t panic or rush feelings.
That self-control makes you strong in chaos.`,

`You care deeply, but you show it through actions.
Showing up, helping, staying.
That is your language, and it’s intentional.`,

`You become strongest when life gets hardest.
In comfort, you stay quiet.
In chaos, you become steady and focused.`,

`You don’t need to be understood by everyone.
You’re okay being misunderstood by most, as long as a few truly see you.
I see you, and that matters to me.`
